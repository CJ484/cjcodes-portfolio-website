          I am a Front-End Developer with a unique dual-lens: the precision of a technical webmaster and the creative eye of freehand artist. My journey into tech began with a childhood curiosity sparked by shows like &quot;Code Lyoko&quot;, which evolved into a career dedicated to building and meticulously maintaining high performance web experiences.

        <p className="bioSection__paragraph">
          My background in freehand drawing allows me to bridge the gap between
          artistic vision and technical implementation, ensuring websites are as 
          beautiful as they are functional.

        <p className="bioSection__paragraph">
          I have experience in React and Agile Methodologies. I got into coding
          by watching movies and shows like for some of you who remembers
          &quot;Code Lyoko&quot; or &quot;The Core&quot;.

        <p className="bioSection__paragraph">
          Every job I have received they would call me the &quot;IT guy&quot;. I
          have a natural aptitude for troubleshooting complex systems and a
          'maintenance-first' mindset. I have always been interested in
          technology and how it works. I am a very curious person and love to
          learn new things.

        <p className="bioSection__paragraph">
          I am currently seeking a new opportunity where I can apply my curiosity and technical rigor to help a team or business thrive.
